                        <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                        <p class="lead">I'm an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant, Certified Postpartum Doula and Clinical Psychologist.</p>

                        <p> I'm originally from France and arrived in San
                        Francisco with my husband in 2006. I have two children
                        (5 and 1 years old) and we currently live in Bernal
                        Heights.</p>

                        <p>
                        My job is my passion. Newborns are amazing and studies
                        demonstrate time and again the abilities they have,
                        especially with communication and reaction to their
                        close environment: they are instantly active partners
                        in the relationship. I am fascinated by early
                        interactions between moms and babies. If there are some
                        instinctive feelings and behaviors, moms and babies
                        still have to adjust to them and learn to understand
                        each other. They create their own language and mutually
                        work on "attunement", or how parents react to their
                        babies' moods and emotions. The simple way to hold or
                        touch a baby makes the mom unique and has a lot of
                        significance for her baby, who identifies her as
                        knowledgeable, and above all caring and nurturing.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        I have luckily found a way to use my previous skills in
                        the field of psychology to explore such a fundamental
                        area of human interaction. Because of my work as a
                        psychologist, I know how to work confidentially, with
                        respect for personal opinions, choices and histories. I
                        work with partners and fathers as well. I am devoted to
                        offering emotional support and practical information to
                        new parents, and will do my best to adjust to each
                        family's specific needs. I learn from every family with
                        which I work.
                        </p>
                        <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
                        <p>
                        The first weeks and months after your baby's birth are
                        very special yet highly challenging for you as new
                        parents, as you need time to adjust to your new
                        responsibilities. My role is to help you both during
                        this transition, to allow you to rest and recover at
                        your own rhythm, to ease the communication and support
                        you emotionally, and to help you to benefit from my
                        education and experience, in the respect of your
                        personal and family styles. You have to make many
                        choices for your baby, I support parents' decisions and
                        encourage you to find your own way with parenthood.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        According to many resources and different cultures, the
                        recovery/postpartum period is defined as between 6
                        weeks... and up to 2 years! Everyone's experience is
                        unique and should be taken seriously. Each mother
                        should receive the appropriate help and support she
                        needs to follow her own rhythm and individual recovery
                        time. Make things easier for her can help to prevent
                        postpartum depression and facilitate the bonding with
                        her little one.

                                important for us, was her wonderful calm kind

                                “Caroline made our first 6 weeks of parenthood much easier.
                                She showed us how to understand our daughter and her needs,
                                which helped us to be better, calmer, and more confident
                                parents. Without her help it would have taken us months
                                instead of weeks to feel as confident and comfortable as we
                                do now.”</p>

                                “We heard about Caroline from a friend. When
                                she arrived she weighed our baby and it turned
                                out she was still losing weight, because she
                                was actually not getting enough milk. Caroline
                                helped us make a plan to address 3 different
                                goals: getting our baby to gain back her birth
                                weight, increasing and stabilizing my milk
                                supply and improve her breastfeeding skills.
                                She also helped us find a schedule and feeding
                                techniques/positions that worked for us so that
                                we would be more relaxed and rested. By day 14
                                all our 3 goals were achieved and the 3 of us
                                were feeling much better. I doubt this would
                                have gone so smoothly without Caroline's help
                                and there is a good chance we would have given
                                up on breastfeeding.”</p>

                                    individually to find out their particular needs. We offer many services to our
                                    families, but our main goals are to help “mother the mother”, and nurture the
                                    entire family as they transition into life with a newborn. This would include
                                    doing things to help mom and partner feel more confident in their roles,
                                    sharing education on family adjustment and tending to the unique needs of a new
                                    mother.  </p>
                                    <p> Services offered include: breastfeeding
                                    support, routine newborn care and instruction (including bathing, cord care,
                                    diapering, calming techniques, sleeping, newborn nutrition and development),
                                    moral support, household help (including laundry, light housekeeping, grocery
                                    shopping, and meal preparation), accompanying mother and baby to first outings
                                    or medical appointments.  </p>

                                    Some parents will prefer to stay close to their baby at night and the daytime
                                    doula will help them to nap during the day, so they stay well-rested. I tend to
                                    help families to find strategies to deal with common challenges, that won't
                                    imply to have someone coming for long hours and take over. I want to empower
                                    the parents I work with and allow them to go through those first weeks without
                                    feeling like they 'need' night help - if they don't have to or if they don't
                                    necessarily want to. I won't hesitate to suggest night support when there is a

                                    of Lactation Consultant Examiners. Every
