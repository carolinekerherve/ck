<span style="font-weight:bold">PREPARING FOR BABY</span>
<br/>
During pregnancy, a mom and her partner are inevitably inundated by advice
regarding the care, health, sleep patterns, and development of the baby-to-be.
Classes, books, dvds, friends and family, even strangers on the street, offer a
specific perspective about how everything should happen as soon as the baby is
out. Virtually no part of the post-partum experience has been left unstudied,
or un-monetized. Watch out! These viewpoints don’t consider the two most
important elements of this time in life: you and your baby.

</p>
<p>
In preparation for having your baby, I am able to offer private prenatal
sessions in the comfort of your own home. In a direct, clear way we can sit
together and discuss every facet of preparation for welcoming you and your baby
home, how to optimize the first precious few weeks, baby bonding, breastfeeding
preparation, newborn sleep and development, newborn care, even necessary vs.
excess baby gear. I’ll answer your questions with an answer tailored to your
life and family. In this way I can empower moms to feel confident in their
choices during what feels often like an overwhelming time. Being ready means
being able to enjoy instead of worry.

<span style="font-weight:bold">REACHING OUT FOR SUPPORT</span>
<br/>
As a post-partum doula and International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC), I get calls every day from mothers wondering why their baby is doing the exact opposite of what the books, classes, and experts from all the prenatal preparation told them to expect. That’s because your baby, with you as his/her parent, has never been done before! You may need help in the adaptation and application of all the methodology running through your head. Prescriptive applications of “standard” or “traditional” techniques for breastfeeding, sleep strategies, and myriad other issues that will arise don’t work in such a sensitive, delicate time. I have a deep well of practical experience to draw on from my years as a postpartum doula, and offer the integration and application of that experience for a healthy, happy family. Plus I am regularly adding to my repertoire in formal and informal education settings, and in collaboration with others in the birthing and family support fields, all so that I may learn and refine the strategies I bring to the varied families I work with. I am your ally in your home.

<span style="font-weight:bold">GETTING BACK TO BEING YOU</span>
<br/>
The time immediately following birth is exceptional in every way. It is not a time for judgment – of yourself or by others. During my professional years in France, before moving with my husband to San Francisco, I worked as a licensed psychologist. Not a day goes by now in my post-partum work that I don’t utilize that training in support of women. I try to reconnect them with the energy of who they have always been, acting as a mirror to reflect back the confident, intelligent woman they were, and will feel like again.

                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>
                            Originally from a small town, just north of Paris, I
                            completed my Master’s Degree in Psychology (Paris V
                            University - 2002) and was a practicing clinical
                            psychologist before I met, married, and moved with my
                            husband to San Francisco in 2006.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I became interested in doula services after having my
                            daughter in 2008 and I realized the ways in which I
                            needed help as a new mom and was then able to help my
                            friends with their new babies around the same time. It
                            was a very natural extension of my work in psychology
                            to explore such a fundamental area of the human
                            experience. Mother-baby, father-baby, and mother-father
                            dynamics are endlessly fascinating to me, and because
                            of my training, I work confidentially and respectfully
                            of the personal opinions, choices and histories that
                            affect those dynamics. I became a Certified Lactation
                            Educator and Counselor in 2009 (University of
                            California San Diego) and then was trained and
                            certified as a Postpartum Doula through the American
                            Association of Doulas in 2010 (Dona International ).

                            In early 2012 I gave birth to my son and, going through
                            a new postpartum period myself, I was motivated to
                            continue my education and improve the quality of my
                            services for new moms. I decided to increase my
                            knowledge and experience in breastfeeding by entering
                            the Lactation Consultant training program with UCSD and
                            became an International Board Certified Lactation
                            Consultant (<a href="http://iblce.org">IBCLC</a> - 2013) I
                            observed and interacted with over 200 breastfeeding
                            dyads (mom-baby couples) during my training at Kaiser
                            Hospital San Francisco and Day One Support Center San
                            Francisco. My training also gave me the opportunity to
                            observe a wide range of breastfeeding situations and to
                            be trained for response by several very experienced
                            IBCLCs.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am continuously in awe of the mothers, babies, and
                            families I work with and I am devoted to offering
                            emotional support and practical information to each of
                            them. Having grown up in France, I was raised with a
                            set of principles regarding birthing, child rearing,
                            and family that were very different with respect to
                            norms and values than in the United States. Today, as a
                            mother and professional living in San Francisco, I have
                            the opportunity to take the best practices of the
                            French and integrate them with American customs and the
                            unique needs of each family I work with. There isn’t
                            one right way to raise a baby and happiness and
                            confidence in so doing isn’t dependent on following the
                            methods of a particular culture or trend. It's about
                            assessing what works and what doesn't work for each
                            family, and I integrate a vast body of knowledge from
                            my culture, education, and practical experience to
                            support the unique needs of each of my families. I act
                            as their ally, and can act as such for you, too.

She is wonderful at helping you with any issue you may have, and one of her best qualities is how much she encourages, educates and helps build the confidence of a new mama. She helped with lactation issues, questions about sleep, schedule, baby wearing, bath time, etc. I have a super successful breastfeeding story with my healthy little four month old thanks to Caroline's expertise. She is a wealth of knowledge about a wide variety of topics and helps you find what is best for you and your family.”</p>

The day we got home from the hospital, Caroline came to visit and immediately helped me identify how to correct the baby latch and introduced a great way to hold the baby that helped. Do not pass up the chance to work with Caroline as your lactation consultant, it's worth the investment! She has saved us much anxiety that i've seen friends go through, and helped us avoid pitfalls. I love her bedside manner and her positive and reassuring attitude.

As a Type A kind of person who feels like she can do it all, being a new mom quickly taught me that things can get overwhelming. Caroline's mom support group taught me that I'm not the only one feeling that way. The camaraderie and sororal atmosphere was something I looked forward to weekly. Plus, it was nice to get perspective and validation from other moms going through certain milestones and challenges.”

                                    Unfortunately not. In the United States,
                                    the medical community cares for a woman
                                    vigilantly so long as she is carrying the
                                    baby, but once the baby is delivered, the
                                    focus of care switches directly to the
                                    child’s well being.  With the exception of
                                    a standard 15-minute follow up visit 6
                                    weeks postpartum, there is no additional
                                    support or conversation about the need for
                                    proper recuperation and healing for the
                                    mother. Which is very different from the
                                    care received in many other countries.

                                    While you may receive support from an IBCLC
                                    during your hospital stay, the primary
                                    difference between what we do in our
                                    initial meeting at your home and what you
                                    receive in the hospital is time. In the
                                    hospital you get approximately 15 minutes.
                                    With me, we can spend upwards of 1.5 hours,
                                    in order to discuss every facet of how you
                                    are feeling, your questions, concerns, and
                                    expectations for the coming days and weeks.
                                    In the hospital, the flood of hormones in
                                    your body just after giving birth make it
                                    physically difficult to recall new
                                    information you receive from the hospital’s
                                    lactation consultant. At your home, we can
                                    evaluate the entire situation, in context,
                                    together. And you will only work with me
                                    throughout your care and follow up,
                                    providing your care as you need it, when
                                    you need it vs. whomever is in the doctors’
                                    office from 9-5 calling for their follow-up
                                    responsibility.

                                    Mothers and families with new babies need
                                    regular and consistent care for at least
                                    the first six weeks, and especially the
                                    first 8 days, after birth. Access to
                                    information and guidance by informed
                                    caregivers is most necessary exactly when
                                    you need it – not weeks before in a
                                    birthing class (too early for it to
                                    register), and not at the 6 week follow up
                                    appointment (too late to be relevant). To
                                    avoid undue stress and in order to best
                                    support the new mother, her baby, and the
                                    extended family, arranging prenatally for
                                    consistent, in-home care is essential.

Moms and other women who’ve “been there” with new babies can be wonderfully
supportive and great resources for sharing general family history. They may
turn out to be a great help to you… or they might not. It can be very
overwhelming to try and take in the anecdotal conversations and all else these
well-wishers have to say at what is a very vulnerable time for you and your
family. In truth, their experiences will all have one thing in common: their
experiences are their own. Having professional postpartum care in your home
means you have a personal advocate. Further, your caregiver will be able to
offer guidance and assistance based on her experience with hundreds of women
and their families that she’s worked with. And caregivers who are also IBCLC
lactation consultants have undergone rigorous training, including classroom
instruction and hundreds of hours of supervised clinical work. They are up to
date on current practices and have a wide breadth of experience to draw from.

                                    70-100% back. Please call your insurance to
