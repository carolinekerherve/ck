.SH "INSTALL"

.SS "OpenSSL"
.IX Subsection "OpenSSL"
You must have OpenSSL installed before compiling this module. You can get
the latest OpenSSL package from <http://www.openssl.org/>. We no longer
support pre\-2000 versions of OpenSSL.
.PP
If you are building OpenSSL from source, please follow the directions
included in the package.
.PP
If you are going to use an OpenSSL library which you built from source or
whose header and library files are not in a place searched by your compiler
by default, make sure you set appropriate environment variables before
trying to build \f(CW\*(C`Crypt::SSLeay\*(C'\fR.
.PP
For example, if you are using ActiveState Perl and MinGW installed using
ppm, and you installed OpenSSL in \f(CW\*(C`C:\eopt\eopenssl\-1.0.1c\*(C'\fR, then you would
issue the following commands to build \f(CW\*(C`Crypt::SSLeay\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    C:\e...\e> set LIBRARY_PATH=C:\eopt\eopenssl\-1.0.1c\elib;%LIBRARY_PATH%
\&    C:\e...\e> set CPATH=C:\eopt\eopenssl\-1.0.1c\einclude;%CPATH%
\&    C:\e...\e> perl Makefile.PL \-\-live\-tests
\&    C:\e...\e> dmake test
.Ve
.PP
On Linux/BSD/Solaris/GNU etc systems, you would use make rather than dmake,
but you would need to set the same variables if your OpenSSL library is in a
custom location. If everything builds \s-1OK,\s0 but you get failures when during
tests, ensure that \f(CW\*(C`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\*(C'\fR points to the location where the
correct shared libraries are located.
.PP
If you are using a Microsoft compiler (keep in mind that perl and OpenSSL
need to have been built using the same compiler as well), you would use:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    C:\e...\e> set LIB=C:\eopt\eopenssl\-1.0.1c\elib;%LIB%
\&    C:\e...\e> set INCLUDE=C:\eopt\eopenssl\-1.0.1c\einclude;%INCLUDE%
\&    C:\e...\e> perl Makefile.PL \-\-live\-tests
\&    C:\e...\e> nmake test
.Ve
.PP
Depending on your \s-1OS,\s0 pre-built OpenSSL packages may be available. You may
need to install a development version of your operating system's OpenSSL
library package. The key is that \f(CW\*(C`Crypt::SSLeay\*(C'\fR makes calls to the OpenSSL
library, and how to do so is specified in the C header files that come
with the library. Some systems break out the header files into a separate
package from that of the libraries. Once the program has been built, you
don't need the headers any more.
.SS "Crypt::SSLeay"
.IX Subsection "Crypt::SSLeay"
The latest Crypt::SSLeay can be found at your nearest \s-1CPAN,\s0 as well as
<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Crypt\-SSLeay/>.
.PP
Once you have downloaded it, \f(CW\*(C`Crypt::SSLeay\*(C'\fR installs easily using the
standard build process:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    perl Makefile.PL
\&    make
\&    make test
\&    make install
.Ve
.PP
On Windows systems, both Strawberry Perl and ActiveState (as a separate
download via ppm) projects include a MingW based compiler distribution and
dmake which can be used to build both OpenSSL and \f(CW\*(C`Crypt::SSLeay\*(C'\fR. If you
have such a set up, use dmake above.
.PP
\&\fIMakefile.PL\fR takes two optional arguments:
.ie n .IP """\-\-live\-tests""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-live\-tests\fR" 4
.IX Item "--live-tests"
Boolean. Specifies whether we should try to connect to an \s-1HTTPS URL\s0 during
testing. Default is false.
.Sp
To skip live tests, you can use
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perl Makefile.PL \-\-no\-live\-tests
.Ve
.Sp
and to force live tests, you can use
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perl Makefile.PL \-\-live\-tests
.Ve
.ie n .IP """\-\-static""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "--static"
Boolean. Default is false. (\fB\s-1TODO\s0\fR: Does it work?)
.PP
For unattended (batch) installations, to be absolutely certain that
\&\fIMakefile.PL\fR does not prompt for questions on \s-1STDIN,\s0 set the environment
variable \f(CW\*(C`PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1\*(C'\fR as with any \s-1CPAN\s0 module built using
ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
.PP
\fIWindows\fR
.IX Subsection "Windows"
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Crypt::SSLeay\*(C'\fR builds correctly with Strawberry Perl and ActiveState Perl
using the bundled MinGW.
.PP
For ActiveState Perl users, the ActiveState company does not have a permit
from the Canadian Federal Government to distribute cryptographic software.
This prevents \f(CW\*(C`Crypt::SSLeay\*(C'\fR from being distributed as a \s-1PPM\s0 package from
their repository.
.PP
See <http://docs.activestate.com/activeperl/5.16/faq/ActivePerl\-faq2.html#crypto_packages>
for more information on this issue. You may be able to download a \s-1PPM\s0 for
\&\f(CW\*(C`Crypt::SSLeay\*(C'\fR from an alternative repository (see PPM::Repositories).
.PP
\fI\s-1VMS\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "VMS"
.PP
I do not have any experience with \s-1VMS.\s0 If OpenSSL headers and libraries are
not in standard locations searched by your build system by default, please
set things up so that they are. If you have generic instructions on how to
do it, please open a ticket on \s-1RT\s0 with the information so I can add it to
this document.
.SH "PROXY SUPPORT"
.IX Header "PROXY SUPPORT"
LWP::UserAgent and Crypt::SSLeay have their own versions of
proxy support. Please read these sections to see which one
is appropriate.
.SS "LWP::UserAgent proxy support"
.IX Subsection "LWP::UserAgent proxy support"
\&\f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR has its own methods of proxying which may work for you
and is likely to be incompatible with \f(CW\*(C`Crypt::SSLeay\*(C'\fR proxy support.
To use \f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR proxy support, try something like:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    my $ua = LWP::UserAgent\->new;
\&    $ua\->proxy([qw( https http )], "$proxy_ip:$proxy_port");
.Ve
.PP
At the time of this writing, libwww v5.6 seems to proxy https requests
fine with an Apache \fImod_proxy\fR server.  It sends a line like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    GET https://www.example.com HTTP/1.1
.Ve
.PP
to the proxy server, which is not the \f(CW\*(C`CONNECT\*(C'\fR request that some
proxies would expect, so this may not work with other proxy servers than
\&\fImod_proxy\fR. The \f(CW\*(C`CONNECT\*(C'\fR method is used by \f(CW\*(C`Crypt::SSLeay\*(C'\fR's
internal proxy support.
.SS "Crypt::SSLeay proxy support"
.IX Subsection "Crypt::SSLeay proxy support"
For native \f(CW\*(C`Crypt::SSLeay\*(C'\fR proxy support of https requests,
you need to set the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`HTTPS_PROXY\*(C'\fR to your
proxy server and port, as in:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # proxy support
\&    $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY} = \*(Aqhttp://proxy_hostname_or_ip:port\*(Aq;
\&    $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY} = \*(Aq127.0.0.1:8080\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
Use of the \f(CW\*(C`HTTPS_PROXY\*(C'\fR environment variable in this way
is similar to \f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\-\*(C'\fR\fIenv_proxy()\fR> usage, but calling
that method will likely override or break the \f(CW\*(C`Crypt::SSLeay\*(C'\fR
support, so do not mix the two.
.PP
Basic auth credentials to the proxy server can be provided
this way:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # proxy_basic_auth
\&    $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY_USERNAME} = \*(Aqusername\*(Aq;
\&    $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY_PASSWORD} = \*(Aqpassword\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
For an example of \s-1LWP\s0 scripting with \f(CW\*(C`Crypt::SSLeay\*(C'\fR native proxy
support, please look at the \fIeg/lwp\-ssl\-test\fR script in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Crypt::SSLeay\*(C'\fR distribution.
.SH "CLIENT CERTIFICATE SUPPORT"
.IX Header "CLIENT CERTIFICATE SUPPORT"
Client certificates are supported. \s-1PEM\s0 encoded certificate and
private key files may be used like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $ENV{HTTPS_CERT_FILE} = \*(Aqcerts/notacacert.pem\*(Aq;
\&    $ENV{HTTPS_KEY_FILE}  = \*(Aqcerts/notacakeynopass.pem\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
You may test your files with the \fIeg/net\-ssl\-test\fR program,
bundled with the distribution, by issuing a command like:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    perl eg/net\-ssl\-test \-cert=certs/notacacert.pem \e
\&        \-key=certs/notacakeynopass.pem \-d GET $HOST_NAME
.Ve
.PP
Additionally, if you would like to tell the client where
the \s-1CA\s0 file is, you may set these.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $ENV{HTTPS_CA_FILE} = "some_file";
\&    $ENV{HTTPS_CA_DIR}  = "some_dir";
.Ve
.PP
Note that, if specified, \f(CW$ENV{HTTPS_CA_FILE}\fR must point to the actual
certificate file. That is, \f(CW$ENV{HTTPS_CA_DIR}\fR is *not* the path were

but you may configure \fIeg/net\-ssl\-test\fR to use your \s-1CA\s0 cert
with the \-CAfile option.
.PP
