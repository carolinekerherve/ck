Over the past 2 months, I have been incredibly fortunate to work with Caroline. She has been amazing! My recovery has been much easier, and I am a much better mother as a result of her encouragement and advice.

She has been an incredible support to me and my family. As a certified lactation counselor, she was extremely helpful in working through breastfeeding challenges. She also helped me to understand my baby's needs and schedule. And she always lent a helping hand in anyway that she could, from helping with laundry to making fantastic meals. She has truly been wonderful.

I was encouraged by my OB and GP to find a post partum doula and a lactation counselor/consultant. My husband and I are very independent and were not convinced that we needed one, but we found Caroline (who is both) just before our daughter was born.

Caroline came over the day after we returned from the hospital. She was a huge help with getting the right latch for breastfeeding, finding comfortable locations to breastfeed, and generally helping me and my husband figure out how to take care of our new born. Caroline will help you with anything. And an added bonus - Caroline is just a wonderful person who is delightful to talk with. I definitely recommend getting a post partum doula even if you don't think you need the support - you'll be surprised.





Lactation support

Sue

I remember the first day I called Caroline. Our baby was 7 days old, and my milk still hadn't come in. On top of that, I was bone tired following the advice of our lactation consultant. On top of the major sleep deprivation (that comes with having a baby, plus having all these milk issues), I was a nervous wreck, because I really wanted to breastfeed!  So that day when I called her, I was bawling. Her first comments were to reassure me, that I am doing everything that I can.. and encourage me that I am being a great mom. From that point on, she started coming regularly, until our little one was about 8 weeks old. She was instrumental in me having the courage to stop supplementing and gaining confidence in my milk supply.

Christine

I decided to work with Caroline when I was 29 weeks pregnant - and then delivered (unexpectedly) a week later.  Caroline suggested she come to my house when my milk came in to help me pump (my son came so early that he couldn't nurse yet). I admit that I was a bit skeptical that I'd learn anything new about pumping from her, because I had worked with the lactation consultants in the hospital.  WRONG. Caroline really opened my eyes about proper pumping technique.  My son was in the hospital for two months, and my milk production was the envy of the NICU.

An out-of-town friend recently had a baby and called me to ask about pumping.  She said she learned more from a half hour on the phone with me than she learned from two lactation consultants - and everything I know I learned from Caroline. It is rare for preemie mothers to have good milk production, and it is rare for very premature babies to learn how to nurse - even without a back injury in the mix.  I can say with 100% certainty that my son and I would not have a nursing relationship today if it weren't for Caroline's skillful instruction and gentle encouragement.

Rupa

We met Caroline one month before our baby arrived, and we chatted a lot about what to expect the first few weeks, and about potential challenges surrounding breastfeeding.  It turns out I did need her lactation knowledge a lot because I had an emergency c-section and my milk was delayed.  She helped me so much when I was about to give up and resort to bottle and formula feeding.  I am now breastfeeding with no problems at all.



Emotional support

Sara

Caroline came to my rescue the week I got home from the hospital. She was a godsend! She provided really valuable emotional support talking through my difficult birth experience with me. I don't know what we would have done without her!

Anna

I was worried about the post-partum transition since my mother had post-partum depression, and knowing that Caroline would be there the day we got home from the hospital was reassuring.  Over the six weeks following she encouraged me and supported me and helped me learn, making it possible for me to rest, feel good about myself, and become competent. I oftky enough to work with Caroline when our baby was 8 weeks old, and I only wish we'd found her earlier! Sure, we had family support with our newborn, and we were hanging in there, always optimistic that the next day would be easier, etc., but let's face it: having a newborn in the house is hard work! I was so appreciative of Caroline's ability to sum up a situation and make simple suggestions that have helped the whole family. She is also a wonderful listener, and encouraged me to follow my own intuition as a mother, reassuring me that what she saw me doing made sense. Caroline also made sure to attend to my own postpartum recovery and helped me figure out how to best take care of myself.



Teaching/Coaching and Newborn Care

Anna

It was great to have her there to teach me technical skills and just get things going when I was overwhelmed. She helped me set up the breast pump and start pumping, she observed breastfeeding closely and advised me, she showed me how to bathe the baby, she taught me how to put on the Moby carrier, she brought items from the baby store when I didn't have a chance to go.  Most importantly, she was wonderful with my son when I needed a break--very soothing and gentle.  She got him to sleep for longer on his own in the crib than anyone has yet.

Sue

Caroline helped me tremendously when my baby became super colicky around 3 weeks old. At that point, I was bone tired from walking around SF all day long so my baby would sleep (nothing else worked! and we tried it all...). Caroline would come in the afternoon, and take over, letting me get much needed rest. She also provided helpful suggestions to soothe our little one. At 6 to 7 weeks, I called Caroline again to help me transition from walking everywhere, to getting her to sleep in a bassinet. She spent the time to help me understand my baby's sleep signals.. and showed me how she puts babies down.

Brenna

We used Caroline for the first 3 weeks of our first child's life and she was amazing!  From breastfeeding help to basic education for us to just taking the baby after a nursing and letting me get a few hours of sleep she was a godsend!  She is sweet but assertive and was great with teaching both myself and my husband about techniques that worked for her and the such.  I wish I could have her everyday... ;)
