About Me

Education and Certifications

Before arriving in the US in 2007, I was working full time as a clinical psychologist in France. I have a Master's Degree in Psychology (Paris V University - 2002).

I became interested in doula services after having a baby girl in 2008, here in San Francisco, and helping my friends with their new babies. First I became a Certified Lactation Educator and Counselor (University of California San Diego, Gini Baker - 2009) and then was certified as a Postpartum Doula through the biggest and most recognized American Association of Doulas (Dona International - 2010). I gave birth to a baby boy in March 2012 and going through a new postpartum period myself helped me keep improving the quality of my services.

I decided to increase my knowledge and experience in breastfeeding by entering the Lactation Counsultant training program with UCSD in 2012-2013. I took the exam in July 2013 to become a certified IBCLC, the most advanced certification in this field as IBCLCs are the premier providers of care for breastfeeding and human lactation. I have observed and interacted with over 200 breastfeeding dyads during my training, at Kaiser San Francisco and Day One San Francisco Center. It gave me the opportunity to observe a wide range of specific situations and to be trained by several very experienced IBCLCs.





What I do and my philosophy

The first weeks and months after your baby's birth are very special yet highly challenging for you as new parents, as you need time to adjust to your new responsibilities. My role is to help you both during this transition, to allow you to rest and recover at your own rhythm, to ease the communication and support you emotionally, and to help you to benefit from my education and experience, in the respect of your personal and family styles. You have to make many choices for your baby, I support parents' decisions and encourage you to find your own way with parenthood.



According to many resources and different cultures, the recovery/posarents react to their babies' moods and emotions. The simple way to hold or touch a baby makes the mom unique and has a lot of significance for her baby, who identifies her as knowledgeable, and above all caring and nurturing.

I am very happy to have found a way to use my previous skills in the field of psychology to explore such a fundamental area of human interaction. There is always a lot to learn about mothers and babies, but also fathers and babies, which keeps me motivated and interested. Because of my work as a psychologist, I know how to work confidentially, with respect for personal opinions, choices and histories.

I am devoted to offering emotional support and practical information to you as new parents, and will do my best to adjust to your specific needs. I feel that I learn from every family with which I work.





All my vaccinations are up to date and I am Trustline registered.

I am also CPR certified (Adult, Infant &amp; Child).
