# Whaaat...?

sources are in src/ but are meant to generate static files to be served under /live directory.
This is what is currently rendered at http://yannkerherve.bitbucket.org/live/

So... templates are in src/ but (last) rendered result is in live/

It's unfinished and probably doesn't quite work.

images are in: src/assets/
